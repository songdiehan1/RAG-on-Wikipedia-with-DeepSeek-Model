# üß† DeepSeek-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Wikipedia with DeepSeek Model

## üìñ Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system based on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B model, specifically designed to answer questions using the Wikipedia dataset. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
LangChain: A framework for building applications powered by language models.
Chroma: A vector database for efficient document retrieval.
BM25 Retriever: A classic retrieval model for document ranking.
BGE-Embedding: Bi-directional Generative Embedding.
BGE reranker: A powerful reranking algorithm that refines retrieved document.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
To get started, install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash

```

## üìù Example
Here's an example of how the system works:
```bash
rag = WikiRAG()
question = "When did Lincoln begin his political career?"
answer = rag.ask(question)
print(f"Question: {question}")
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```

```bash

Okay, so I need to figure out when Abraham Lincoln began his political career. I'll start by looking at the provided context from the source datasets. 

The first source mentions that Lincoln began his political career in 1832 at the age of 23, running for the Illinois General Assembly as a member of the Whig Party, but he was unsuccessful. That seems pretty straightforward. It clearly states the year he started, so that should be the answer.

Looking at the second source, it talks about Lincoln winning the Republican Party nomination in 1860 and being elected president that year. While this is important, it's about a later part of his career, not the beginning. So this doesn't add new information about when he started.

The third source discusses Lincoln practicing with a broad sword and entering law practice with William Herndon in 1854. It also mentions his marriage in 1842 and his involvement with the Republican Party in 1854. While this provides additional context about his personal life and later political activities, it doesn't directly answer when he began his political career.

Putting it all together, the first source is the most relevant because it explicitly states the year Lincoln started his political career. The other sources provide supplementary information but don't contradict or add to the specific question about the start date.
